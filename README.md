## Introduction

gPhoto2.NET is an easy-to-use .NET wrapper for the popular gPhoto2. It can be used to easily interface with DSLRs or other types of cameras from a
.NET application. gPhoto2.NET was developed using Mono on Linux and was specifically made for the use on Raspberry Pi.

## Current Status of the Project

The project is currently not yet ready for prime time. It is in an early alpha stage where a lot of vital features are still missing or do not work
as expected. Ultimately the library should be usable on Raspberry Pi, but I am not sure if it runs or builds on a Raspberry Pi right now, since the
project is currently developed in a Linux desktop environment. Any help, e.g. feature requests or bug reports, is greatly appreciated. Please use
GitHub's issue system for that. If you want to improve on my work or fix bugs, then feel free to fork this project and send me a pull request.

## Acknowledgements

This project would not be possible without the great contributions of the open source community. gPhoto2.NET was build using these awesome open
source projects:

 - **[gPhoto2](http://www.gphoto.org/)** - gPhoto2 is a free, redistributable, ready to use set of digital camera software applications for Unix-like systems, written by a whole team of dedicated volunteers around the world. It supports more than 2100 cameras.
