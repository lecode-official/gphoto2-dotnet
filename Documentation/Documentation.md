gPhoto2.NET is an easy-to-use .NET wrapper for the popular gPhoto2. It can be used to easily interface with DSLRs or other types of cameras from a
.NET application. gPhoto2.NET was developed using Mono on Linux and was specifically made for the use on Raspberry Pi.

# Status of the Documentation

Please note that this documentation is very much a work in progress. New chapters will be added in the future. Right now the focus lies on
perfecting the parts of the documentation that help you get started, so that you are able to start using the gPhoto2.NET as fast as possible.

# Samples

Please note, that there is a sample project checked into the repository, which demonstrates much of the functionality the library provides.
You can find the sample application [here](https://github.com/lecode-official/gphoto2-dotnet/tree/master/Samples).
